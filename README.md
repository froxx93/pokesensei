# PokéSensei

With this app you can test and improve your knowledge about Pokémon.

## Contribution

I'm always happy to see contribution in any way. This shall not be my project alone.

Have an idea on how to improve PokéSensei? New questions, better UI / UX, any other feature idea? Open up an issue. (And search existing ones for your idea first to prevent dupes of course.)

Can develop yourself? Open up a pull request. I'm putting high value in good architecture though, so be warned :)

Also I'm pretty picky about what actually goes into the project, so your best chances to get an approved PR is probably to check out the issues page and look for an approved feature that is not yet built. Also be sure not to commit any console or lint errors, console.logs, etc.

npm i
npm run dev
