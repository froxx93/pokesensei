## Contribution

I'm always happy to see contribution of any kind.

You can't develop? No problem! Your creativity is still greatly appreciated. So do you have an idea on how to improve PokéSensei? Found a bug, have an idea for new questions, better UI / UX, or anything else? Go to the [issue page](https://github.com/p-runge/pokesensei/issues) and check if there is already an existing issue regarding your change. If there isn't, create a new one!

Can you develop yourself? Do the same thing. Then – if your idea got approved – feel free to open up a pull request.

I'm pretty picky about what actually goes into the project, so please avoid immediately creating a PR for your ideas to prevent having done all of that work for nothing.

Also please double check to not commit any lint errors, console.logs, or any other leftover things from your development process.

I'm not using conventional commits in this project, but please still use fitting and self-explaining commit messages regarding your changes. `Fixed some bugs` is NOT a good commit message :)
